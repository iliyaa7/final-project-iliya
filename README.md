in this project i have built my own api with node js, express and some libraries and modules like celbrate (and more others) for validation and other functionalities.

I have also built a responsive clinet side via react, and connected it to third party api and a the one i built before that.

the project was deployed to a virtual machine and registered to a domain for easy acsses.
